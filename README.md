## OpenSDP College-Going Pathways (R)

This repository contains web guides, Stata data visualization code, and sample
data to help education data analysts answer questions about patterns and trends
in studentsâ€™ on-track status in ninth grade, high school graduation, college
enrollment, college persistence, and patterns and trends along the education
pipeline. The College-Going Pathways materials can also be accessed on the
OpenSDP website at [opensdp.github.io/analysis](https://opensdp.github.io/analysis).

The code in this repository is based on code from the "Analyze" section of the
[Strategic Data Project Toolkit for Effective Data Use](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/toolkit-effective-data-use),
modified to work with synthetic data generated by the
[OpenSDPsynthR](https://github.com/opensdp/OpenSDPsynthR) data simulation engine. The
College-Going Pathways guides and code will also work with college-going
analysis files prepared to the [SDP data specification](https://github.com/strategicdataproject/opensdp/raw/gh-pages/assets/images/sdp_college_going_analysis_file_data_specification.pdf).

This repository is organized in the following folder structure:

- `R` contains R functions necessary to complete the analyses
- `data` contains data necessary to complete the analysis
- `figure` contains image files for the figures in the guide
- `img` contains image and style assets to format the guides
- `docs` contains the rendered documents and the markdown scripts to build them

These materials were originally authored by the Strategic Data Project.

[OpenSDP](https://opensdp.github.io) is an online, public repository of analytic
code, tools, and training intended to foster collaboration among education
analysts and researchers in order to accelerate the improvement of our school
systems. The community is hosted by the
[Strategic Data Project](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu), an initiative of the
[Center for Education Policy Research at Harvard University](https://cepr.harvard.edu).
We welcome contributions and feedback.
